In the example below, usernames are shown along with the number of points in a contest.
If the bdi element is not supported in the browser, the ussername of the Arabic user would confuse the text (the bidirection algorithm would put the colon and the number "90" next to the world "User" rather than next to the word "points").

<ul>
	<li>User <bdi>hrefs</bdi>: 60 points</li>
	<li>User <bdi>jdoe</bdi>: 80 points</li>
	<li>User <bdi>إيان</bdi>: 90 points</li>
</ul>
