<p>HTML5 introduced a method to let web designers take control over the viewport, through the <  meta> tag.
<br>

The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. It varies with the device, and will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.
<br>
A < meta> viewport element gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.
<br>

The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).
<br>

The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.
