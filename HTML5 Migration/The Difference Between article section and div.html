<p>There is a confusing (lack of) difference in the HTML5 standard, between &lt;article&gt; &lt;section&gt; and &lt;div&gt;.<br>

In the HTML5 standard, the &lt;section&gt; element is defined as a block of related elements.<br>

The &lt;article&gt; element is defined as a complete, self-contained block of related elements.<br>


The &lt;div&gt; element is defined as a block of children elements.<br>


How to interpret that?<br>


In the example above, we have used &lt;section&gt; as a container for related &lt;articles&gt;.<br>


But, we could have used &lt;article&gt; as a container for articles as well.</p>
