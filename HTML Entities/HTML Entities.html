<pre><p>Some characters are reserved in HTML.
If you use the less than (&lt;&#60;) or greater then (&gt;&#62;) signs in your text,the browser might mix them with tags.
Character entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML.
A character entity looks like this:
&amp;entity_name;
OR
&38;#entity_number;
To display a less then sign (&#60;) we must write <strong>&amp;lt;</strong> or <strong>&#38;#60;</strong>
<strong>Advantage of using an entity name:</strong> An entity name is easy to remember.
<strong>Disadvantage of using entity name:</strong> Browser may not support all entity names,but the support for numbers is good.</p></pre>
